<p><strong>Nodedit is a web-based, thin-client IDE.</strong></p>

<p>Nodedit is a thin-client IDE that runs completely in the browser. To work with files you connect to an instance of the <a href="https://github.com/Fluidbyte/Nodedit-Server">Nodedit-Server</a> which controls I/O with the remote filesystem. Simply provide the URL (and port) as well as an API key and that's it.</p>

<h2>
<a name="running-nodedit" class="anchor" href="#running-nodedit"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Running Nodedit</h2>

<p>As mentioned above, ensure that you have an instance of <a href="https://github.com/Fluidbyte/Nodedit-Server">Nodedit-Server</a> running on a server.</p>

<p>Once you have a server to connect to just open the client. You can run it locally or serve it from a webserver, it has no rquirements except a modern web browser.</p>

<p>You can also access an instance with the latest build at <a href="http://noded.it">Noded.it</a>.</p>

<h2>
<a name="license--usage" class="anchor" href="#license--usage"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>License &amp; Usage</h2>

<p>Both the Nodedit Client and Server are released under the MIT-style open source license and are free to use, modify, break, tweak, etc to your hearts content. All that is asked is you mention your use of the code somewhere.</p>

<h2>
<a name="contributing" class="anchor" href="#contributing"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Contributing</h2>

<p>The system is still very new. While there has been extensive testing and building of stuff to prevent any data-breaking there still are a myriad of things that can be tested, improved upon, added to, and so on and so forth.</p>

<p>If you'd like to contribute please follow these steps:</p>

<ol>
<li>Create an issue. Select an appropriate label from the list and describe what you've found, intend to change, add, etc...</li>
<li>Fork and create a branch. Won't get to picky here, but good branching results in easier (and faster) pulls</li>
<li>Follow code conventions. They're pretty obvious. Also, comment your code. No comments === No pull.</li>
<li>Make good commits. Don't just put "fixed it", if we need to revert or just follow the path of changes to identify an issue we want some details</li>
<li>Submit a pull request. Please don't just submit something crappy. Give a title, some moderately in-depth description and maybe some testing criteria.</li>
</ol><p>Good open-source (and code in general) is well organized. Taking a little extra time to ensure your code is understandable goes a long way in keeping things in order and growing a solid application instead of a monolithic beast.</p>
