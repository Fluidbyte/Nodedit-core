<h2>Getting Started</h2>

<h3>The Server</h3>

<p>In order to work with files you must have a server setup. To setup a server please follow <a href="#!/configuring_the_server">this guide</a>.</p>

<h3>The Client</h3>

<p>There really isn't any installation for the Nodedit client. It's built in Javascript so it can run locally or 
    you can place it on a server.
</p>

<p>Using the editor is similar to many IDE's. The two main components are the filemanage in the left-pane and the 
    editor in the right. Right-clicking on files and folders will give you manipulation options and clicking on a 
    file will open it in the editor.
</p>

<p>Tabs for each of the running editor instances appear and can be moved around. Any tabs that overflow the horizontal 
    space available will be added to a drop down for easy access. Closing a tab/editor with unsaved changes will open 
    a dialog confirming you want to discard the changes as well as a diff comparison showing you the changes.
</p>

<p>The system supports uploading files by dragging them from your local system to the desired destination directory. Once 
    the file(s) have uploaded you will see a notification confirming the successful upload (or an error message if there was a problem).
</p>

<p>The 'star' icon in the filemanager is a list of bookmarks. Bookmarks can be created by right-clicking a folder and adding it to the 
    bookmark list. This list allows you to easily jump to specific folders/projects.
