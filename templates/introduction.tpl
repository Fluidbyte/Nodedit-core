<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p><strong>Nodedit is a web-based IDE designed to be lightweight, fast and highly customizable. It is built on a client-server 
    model to facilitate easy access to remote file sources and changing environments.
</strong></p>

<p>Unlike typical IDE's where you edit files locally or on the same server as the client, Nodedit utilizes a client-server model which allows you to connect to remote servers 
using the <a href="#!/configuring_the_server">Nodedit-Server API</a>. This means no matter where your files reside, if you have a server 
setup you can connect to and interact with them.</p>

<p>Nodedit has a clean interface that is geared toward hassle-free interaction. It performs best (and is tested thoroughly on) 
    recent versions of Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox.
