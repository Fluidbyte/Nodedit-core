<h2>Contributing</h2>

<p>This project is still very young and there is much to be added in regards to features, functionality and general 
    application stability.
</p>

<p>Contributions through Git/Github are greatly appreciated, however, please keep a few things in mind:</p>

<p>
<ul>
    <li>The primary goal is simplicity. This isn't Eclipse. The goal of the project is a lightweight and managable application 
        for developers who want to work in a clean environment focusing on the code.
    </li>
    <li>Contributions should adhere to the following workflow and criteria:
        <ul>
            <li>Submit and Issue first. Apply an approriate label and give some detail</li>
            <li>Commit frequently and with detail. Large pushes mean more room for error. Use VCS as intended and give bite-sized chunks so 
                any issues can be addressed quickly and without major rewrites.
            </li>
            <li>Comment, comment, comment. Give some info on what your code does, why, and how to resuse it (if applicable)</li>
            <li>Follow the code conventions. There is no specific guide at this point, however there is a very obvious code format.</li>
            <li>Submit detailed pull requests. "Fixed It" doesn't say anything; a detailed description with replication instructions means PR's can be checked and merged quickly</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>Contibutions can make or break an application. Basically the goal is to submit solid, well documented code. Bugs happen, but if the code is well documented and 
    follows a standard these bugs can be quickly fixed.
