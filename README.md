# Nodedit - Thin-Client IDE

**Nodedit is a web-based, thin-client IDE.**

Nodedit is a thin-client IDE that runs completely in the browser. To work with files you connect to an instance of the [Nodedit-Server](https://github.com/Fluidbyte/Nodedit-Server) which controls I/O with the remote filesystem. Simply provide the URL (and port) as well as an API key and that's it.

## Running Nodedit

As mentioned above, ensure that you have an instance of [Nodedit-Server](https://github.com/Fluidbyte/Nodedit-Server) running on a server.

Once you have a server to connect to just open the client. You can run it locally or serve it from a webserver, it has no rquirements except a modern web browser.

You can also access an instance with the latest build at [Noded.it](http://noded.it).

## License & Usage

Both the Nodedit Client and Server are released under the MIT-style open source license and are free to use, modify, break, tweak, etc to your hearts content. All that is asked is you mention your use of the code somewhere.
