<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Nodedit is a thin-client web-based IDE designed to be lightweight, fast and highly customizable.</p>

<p>Unlike typical IDE's where you edit files locally or on the same server as the client, Nodedit allows you to connect to remote servers 
using the <a href="#!/configuring_the_server">Nodedit-Server API</a>. This means no matter where your files reside, if you have a server 
setup you can connect to and interact with them.</p>
